## Part One: Days After Love

Chapter 1

> What arrogance to say that Roland’s journals were “at times repetitive.” Life is repetitive, she wrote.

> Three volumes into one: These people might as well take a second job as cooks, whisking and reducing Roland’s lifework into a bowl of gravy.

> A story is not always a love story. A book is much more than just pages of words.

Chapter 2

> She would long be dead before they would grow up into something remotely interesting.

> she knew what would happen to the young. Yes, they start out warm and pure like a bucket of fresh milk, but sooner or later they turn sour.  

> Lilia considered it her due to be kept informed of every deterioration. The Titanic would have been a dreary story if all we were allowed to know were its departure from the harbor (like a virgin) and its burial at sea (in its bridal gown).

> specialize in marrying the wrong people

> no more than the vanilla pudding at dinner: low-calorie, no sugar, with barely enough flavor. Who’d have known that she would live to see a day when food prides itself on offering as little as possible?

> an expert at making a life out of disappointments

> She did not have a porous heart, and that, she knew, was the condition disappointments needed as a breeding ground.

Chapter 3

> You have to be careful not to slip into the careless. The care-full live, the care-less die, and when you are dead you are carefree. “But who cares?” Lilia said aloud.

> Put a woman and a diamond together and you get a thousand stories, all uninteresting.

> “I’m sorry to hear that,” Lilia said. “But it’s okay. Everybody dies. It’s not up to you and me to say when.”

> A death from a heart attack and a death from heartbreak were different. It was essential that whatever happened should be told just the way it happened.

> When you’re closer to death, you don’t need much of an excuse to play at being alive again.

> Let me tell you something that most people don’t know. They’ll expect you to always remember the sweetness of being your mother’s child or the bitterness of losing her. They’ll bring you replacements, thinking they’re doing you a favor. But trust me. The days after love are long and empty. It’s up to you and me to make them less so. Those others, they are of no use to us.

Chapter 4

> “a doll who mistakes sentimental for romantic”

> Later, when Lilia was getting ready to leave, she asked him when their next meeting would be.
> 
> Why? Roland said.
> 
> Because there’s always a next time, Lilia said.
> 
> Nobody can guarantee that, he said. I could be run over by a streetcar the moment I step out of the hotel. You could fall in love tomorrow and be married by Saturday.
>
> But things like that don’t happen to us.
> 
> **Why not? What makes you and me different from others?**
> 
> **We aren’t nice people, Lilia said. Tragedies only happen to people nicer than us.**
> 
> **And love at first sight?**
> 
> **To fools.**


Chapter 5

> You know god is a man because he thinks a woman is always waiting to be approached.

> what lengths do people go to to make themselves believe that they have lived a memorable life?

> No need to cry over cracked eggs, but who was crying then? The jumbled idiom had baffled Lilia.

> Perhaps her mother had been consoling herself. All women must have spoken to themselves words unheard by their husbands.

Chapter 6

> Such a trick you could do with money. Lilia’s mother had met the uncle only twice when she was small, and she had had little recollection of him. But he had successfully turned himself into a residential ghost in Lilia’s family. Maybe in the families of other cousins, too. Money always makes a good ghost story.

Chapter 7

> In time the dead no longer remain individually dead. You’re all bundled together, and no one is deader than any other.

> Lilia never liked the phrase “rest in peace,” a saying, she believed, invented to make death sound both ordinary and rewarding. What about “rest in oblivion”? Less pressure for both the living and the dead!

> Pretending is a way to do things that otherwise you don’t get to do.”

Chapter 8

> Lilia had two voices, one for other ears, one for her own. She was not alone in this, but people often made the mistake of letting the latter voice bleed into the former. A sign of weakness, or a sign of aging—Lilia allowed neither.

> Longevity is required for loyalty, and true vindictiveness is like true loyalty, neither of which you can boast of unless you have outlived the shelf life of those perishable feelings called love and hatred. To live a long life is to weed out the people who do not deserve either loyalty or vindictiveness. Lilia always preferred those flowers that blossomed all season long.

## Part Two: Days Last Past
Chapter 1

> the first time she had introduced herself, she had said emphatically that her strength was to be a leader. If you think I’m not good at listening, it’s because I haven’t met many people whose opinions are worth listening to, Elaine said.

> It was worse than having your heart broken. If someone broke your heart, you could still gather the pieces and glue them back, or just leave them scattered around, evidence of what was once your heart. But Lucy’s trick was to make that heart disappear.

Chapter 2

> the more provoked he appeared, the more powerless he would look in front of his wife and children.

> Lilia’s mother had married the wrong man. It was like boarding a train that never takes you in the right direction, let alone to the destination you have in mind. The farther it travels, the less point there is in going on, and the lesser in getting off. What was unforgivable, though, was that she was the kind of woman for whom any husband would be the wrong husband. Why marry, then?

Chapter 3

> calling it poetry would be like reducing an endless field of poppies and lupines to patches of yellow and purple.

> Why settle for something dull and dead on a small canvas, when you can have the live and the real?

Chapter 5

> Lilia wondered if by growing old, by forgetting, by pretending, they had reached the point where the world was new all over. New in what way, though? The world is your oyster but once. The second time all you have are the oyster shells, ready to be ground into powders to fertilize someone else’s garden.

> Yet Lilia, below average as measured by those criteria, could easily understand the boundless strangeness of life, which seemed equally boundlessly inexplicable to her peers. It took her some effort not to point out that everyone present must have done something similarly nonsensical.

> History is like a credit score. Do you live your life in constant consultation with it? You take this or that action, the score gets better or worse, and you live with the result.

> What they did not understand was that she had no use for solitude. No, she was not afraid of being alone, but she preferred to be alone among people.

> Or, perhaps all things timely remembered are wrongly remembered, and it’s only when we pass a certain point, after we forget those things, that we can re-remember them and call it the right way. When does that happen? Middle age? On becoming a grandparent? After an unexpected death? Or an expected death? Hello there, Lilia imagined asking everyone she met. Have you walked through that door already? What door, the person would ask. That door, she would say, the one that opens only once, and when you enter you cannot return. The person might be confused, or incensed, or, if he had a good sense of humor (fat chance), he would say, do you mean the door between life and death? Pah, she would answer. The door you’re talking about is far less interesting than the door I have in mind.

> How strange that one woman’s obsession could become another woman’s, but those who pick up fragments of other people’s lives must be the loneliest ones.

> yet life would be the same, full of strange things that can’t be remembered rightly.

> People are like flowers. Some are born rare species, and they are assigned certified gardeners, and people line up to catch a glimpse when they bloom. Some demand cultivation and maintenance even though they live in an ordinary garden. Some are as common as lupines and poppies. Yet in the end all flowers blossom for the same purpose, and none of them last unless you press them between pages. Once preserved, they take on a gray tint, half transparent, with the lifeless thinness

> It took great discipline for Lilia not to call Marianne a serial killer of flowers.

> That thing people say about memory keeping the deceased alive—there’s no harm in believing in that nonsense just as there’s no harm switching to another brand of toothpaste because you like its commercial. When Roland was alive Sidelle and Hetty must have been like flowers that still bloomed in the sunroom of his mind. But they had become dead specimens in his diaries when he died.
> 
> He would, too, once Lilia died.
> 
> Oh, Roland, someone had better come and inherit you before we become flowers pressed between pages. We can’t be as dead as Hetty.

Chapter 6

> No, Lilia would refuse to feel sad to see the garden go. Her mother had not had much in life, and she should be allowed to take her garden with her.

> Are you calling me stupid?
> 
> By all means no.
> 
> Then you’re one of those men who think it’s okay for girls to know nothing when they’re young, Lilia said. And when they are no longer young you call them stupid.
> 
> And I know what makes animals better than us, Lilia said. Devils feed on our souls, not theirs.
> 
> And who feeds on devils?
> 
> Lilia hesitated. God? she said.
> 
> It isn’t so much a question of whether a person is educated enough to understand the world. It’s whether a person understands the world enough to be able to make something out of a life.

Chapter 7

> with a middle generation missing, a grandchild lingered in a grandchildly way.

> like there was a photographer only Katherine could see, who prompted her to smile in all situations.

> sweetness was never a commendation for any girl.

> Listen, I’ve lived long enough to be a three-time widow, and I can tell you this: If you want a long-lasting marriage you don’t start with love, or obsession, or any of that silliness. You can certainly end with all those things. And you’ll be happier. Trust me, next time you’ll begin in a different place.

Chapter 9

> the delegates’ brains fogged up by cigarette smoke and sleep deprivation.

> Clean and neat boys who still had mothers offering love and care. Kenny was no longer one of them. In the past few weeks he had transformed himself from his mother’s son into his father’s. Lilia resented seeing them on the porch, his father passing a half-smoked cigarette to Kenny to finish. How could two selfish people be drawn so close by mourning?

> The world would never expand for a polite person like you, Lilia thought.

Chapter 10

> I take good care of myself, Lilia said.
> 
> And?
> 
> Men like you would hate it if girls like me complicate your life. But you won’t be satisfied at all if we don’t let you feel that it’s you who has decided how our lives will turn out.

> grandmother had these stories of miners gambling away all their gold. It was not because they didn’t have anything but because they didn’t believe they were meant to be rich. She said they gambled to make sure luck was on their side. And that’s when they lost

> The moment you want to be remembered by another person you give him the power to forget you.

> Lilia had left Gilbert a path, just as Roland had left her a hotel name. Why make life hard? she said. If there’re other women for you, there’ll be other men for me, too. There will always be people. They’re like bricks, and you build a house and live a good life inside.

> Perhaps Roland was not much different from Gilbert. They had to rely on a number too big to imagine to make any small point.

> Unfortunately, it doesn’t fit into any room in any house, Roland said. Rubato tempo, it’s stolen time. Robbed time if you translate literally from Italian.

Chapter 11

> What’s so laughable about everything?
> 
> When you go to a circus show like this, where people take themselves so seriously they don’t even know they’re part of a circus, what else can you do but laugh?

> He knew where to find her but chose not to. Gilbert did, so Gilbert it had to be.

> In the right mood Lilia would allow Roland to be a movie star, the same role she had given him when she was younger. The right mood: not a sentimental one, but one that Lilia—an actress sharing a scene, an audience watching it—could enter and leave freely as she had not been able to in the past. Lilia had lived long enough to know a movie is no more than a lollipop. A lollipop does not cure insomnia or kill pain.

Chapter 12

> You would think life would be particularly cruel to a man like Gilbert, but no, it had been extra careful with him. He didn’t lose either brother when so many brothers had been missing or killed in action. He didn’t have to please a difficult boss. He never understood what it meant to wake up some days, knowing himself to be loved but still feeling lonely. On those mornings, Lilia would stay in bed just a few minutes longer, taming her heart as though it was a difficult horse. Here’s your apple of a house, a good husband, and two cute children, she would offer with an open palm. And let’s be good, easy now, easy now.

> You either choose to be in that circus, or you watch the acrobats and clowns taking themselves seriously. But Roland laughed at everyone. Lilia would still applaud because some people’s feelings should not be hurt.

> Waiting for a letter is worse than waiting for happiness. The latter may never happen, but you don’t allow yourself to believe that. A letter—when it’s not coming it means too much, but once arrived, it never brings enough.

> What bothered her was that she had stopped watching herself from someplace hovering above. Before there had always been two Lilias: one studying herself in the mirror, and the other watching the girl inside and outside the mirror with the same interest; one speaking to a sailor with a pouting face, and the other watching the half-smile hidden underneath. In every moment she had had with Roland there was the other Lilia, assessing herself and Roland. But that Lilia had vanished, and now when she went to the market or exchanged news with her neighbors, when she fed Timmy or played with Lucy or, even, when she lay in bed with Gilbert after the children fell asleep, she felt she could live this life with her eyes closed. A good neighbor, a good wife, and a good mother. Good enough for everyone.

Chapter 13

> The problem with walking down memory lane is that you want to find that very thing the moment you think about it. But life is never arranged accordingly.

> Better to be cruel than to be receiving cruelty.

> Only the muddleheaded would say that spending some time by themselves would clear their heads. The clearheaded—they could be alone or they could be with others and it would not make a smidge of difference to their brains.
